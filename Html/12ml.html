Quality and reliability:Software quality is very important, especially for commercial and system software like Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows and Linux.
If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called "bugs."
 Software is often also a victim to what is known as software aging, the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.
Many bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through software testing. However, software testing rarely – if ever – eliminates every bug;
some programmers say that "every program has at least one more bug" (Lubarsky's Law).In the waterfall method of software development,
separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed agile software development,
developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback.
Software can be tested through unit testing, regression testing and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly,
automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large.
For instance, NASA has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions.
Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs.
This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall.
Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.</font color></font size></h2>
