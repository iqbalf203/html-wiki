<font face="Curlz MT">Architecture:Users often see things differently from programmers.
People who use modern general purpose computers
(as opposed to embedded systems, analog computers and supercomputers)
usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software
<ul>
<li>Platform software: Platform includes the firmware, device drivers, an operating system, and typically a graphical user interface which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its peripherals
(associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer.
On a PC one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.</li>
<li>Application software: Application software or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software.
Typical examples include office suites and video games. Application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware.
Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications.
Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system,
though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other "system software" as applications.</li>
<li>User-written software: End-user development tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and word processor templates.
Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.
uDepending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages,
many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.</li></ul></h3><font face></font color>
