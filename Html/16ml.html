<h3><font face="Curlz MT">A great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry.
Software can be quite a profitable industry: Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft was the richest person in the world in 2009,
largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office software products.
Non-profit software organizations include the Free Software Foundation, GNU Project and Mozilla Foundation. Software standard organizations like the W3C,
IETF develop recommended software standards such as XML, HTTP and HTML,
so that software can interoperate through these standards.
Other well-known large software companies include Oracle, Novell, SAP, Symantec, Adobe Systems, and Corel,
while small companies often provide innovation.</font face></h2>
