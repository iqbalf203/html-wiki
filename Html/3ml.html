 a computer's processor to perform specific operations. Computer software contrasts with computer
 hardware, which is the physical component of computers. Computer hardware and software require
 each other and neither can be realistically used without the other. Using a musical analogy,
 hardware is like a musical instrument and software is like the notes played on that instrument.
