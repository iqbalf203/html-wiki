Programming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that software developers
(also known as programmers, coders, hackers or software engineers) use to create, debug, maintain (i.e. improve or fix),
or otherwise support software. Software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence,
and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools.
These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as compilers, debuggers, interpreters,
linkers, and text editors, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an integrated development environment 
(IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or
 by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project.
 Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.
